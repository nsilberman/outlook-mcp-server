## 🤔 Project Choice: Local vs Cloud Approach

**This project uses win32COM which works entirely locally with your Outlook data (more secure), while our new [Microsoft Graph MCP Server](https://github.com/marlonluo2018/microsoft_graph_mcp_server) provides online access to the full Microsoft 365 ecosystem (more features). Choose based on your security and functionality needs.**

### Why Choose This Project (win32COM)?
- **✅ Local Data Processing**: All email operations happen locally on your computer - no data leaves your machine
- **✅ Enhanced Security**: No cloud authentication or API tokens required - works with your existing Outlook setup
- **✅ Offline Capability**: Access and manage emails even without internet connection
- **✅ Privacy-First**: Your email data never touches external servers or cloud services

### Why Switch to Microsoft Graph API?
- **✅ Full Microsoft 365 Ecosystem**: Access Mail, Calendar, Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint
- **✅ Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices
- **✅ Modern Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with device code flow
- **✅ Cloud-Scale Performance**: No local application dependencies
- **✅ Online Access**: Works directly with cloud-based Microsoft 365 services

### Configuration Troubleshooting 🛠️

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

| Problem | Check This | Solution |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **"uvx not found"** | Is UV installed? | `pip install uv` then retry |
| **"python not found"** | Python in PATH? | Use full path like `C:\Python39\python.exe` |
| **"Outlook not running"** | Outlook window open? | Start Outlook first, then restart MCP |
| **"Permission denied"** | Admin rights? | Run terminal as administrator |
| **"Module not found"** | Dependencies installed? | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |

**Configuration Verification:**
```bash
# Test your setup before connecting to AI
python -c "import outlook_mcp_server; print('✅ Server module loaded')"

# Test Outlook connection (Windows only)
python -c "import win32com.client; outlook = win32com.client.Dispatch('Outlook.Application'); print('✅ Outlook connected')"
```

**MCP Client-Specific Setup:**

## 🔄 How It Works

### Simple Workflow
1. **Load emails**: "Show me recent emails" → Emails appear in cache
2. **Browse results**: View 5 emails per page with clear formatting
3. **Take action**: Reply, move, delete, or get AI summary
4. **Confirm before sending**: AI always asks before sending emails

### AI Assistant Behavior
- **Understands natural language**: "Find urgent emails from my boss"
- **Shows email summaries**: One-line overview + key action items
- **Drafts with context**: Replies understand the conversation
- **Never sends without permission**: Always confirms before sending

### Batch Forwarding Workflow
**1. Prepare Your CSV File**
```csv
email
john@company.com
jane@company.com
team@company.com
```

**2. Use Natural Language**
```
"Forward this email to everyone in my contacts.csv"
"Send this project update to my team list"
"Distribute this newsletter to subscribers.csv"
```

**3. AI Handles the Rest**
- Automatically splits large lists (max 500 per batch)
- Sends via BCC to protect recipient privacy
- Adds your custom message before original email
- Provides delivery confirmation

### Time Savings
**Manual forwarding**: 100 emails × 30 seconds = 50 minutes
**Batch forwarding**: 30 seconds setup + 2 minutes processing = 2.5 minutes
**You save**: 47.5 minutes per batch!

```
"Show me emails from last 3 days"
